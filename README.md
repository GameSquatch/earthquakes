Earthquake Info Hub App
=======================
I want this app to be able to provide information about recent earthquakes, earthquakes near the user, and information by request for earthquakes.

Design Ideas
------------
The landing page should have recent significant earthquakes on it and should have navigation to other methods of information. I'll provide the information that is sent back after a request, so that a designer can use the information to better think about how it might be best to display it.

### JSON info sent back here

The USGS site that has the JSON format and info is <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php" target="_blank">here</a>.
